# PetERP

PetERP is a responsive web interface made to interact and provide an interface for our  [ERP API](https://aun-erp-api.herokuapp.com).

PetERP is built primarily with Django and bootstrap. 
It also uses [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) from python to make api requests.

PetERP is part of a senior design project for the American University of Nigeria.
